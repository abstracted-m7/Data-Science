## What are AI Agents?

AI agents are autonomous software entities that can perceive their environment, make decisions, and take actions to achieve specific goals. Unlike traditional programs that follow predetermined paths, agents can adapt their behavior based on changing conditions and learned experiences.

**Key Definition**: An AI agent is a system that can autonomously perceive, reason, and act in an environment to achieve objectives.

## Key Characteristics

### Autonomy
- Operates independently without constant human intervention
- Makes decisions based on internal logic and external stimuli
- Can initiate actions proactively

### Reactivity
- Responds to changes in the environment
- Processes real-time inputs and adapts behavior accordingly
- Maintains situational awareness

### Proactivity
- Takes initiative to achieve goals
- Plans and executes multi-step strategies
- Anticipates future states and prepares accordingly

### Social Ability
- Interacts with other agents, systems, or humans
- Communicates through defined protocols
- Collaborates or competes as needed

## Agent Architectures

### 1. Reactive Agents
- **Structure**: Stimulus → Response mapping
- **Characteristics**: Fast, simple, no internal state
- **Use Cases**: Real-time systems, reflex behaviors
- **Example**: Obstacle avoidance robots

### 2. Deliberative Agents
- **Structure**: Belief-Desire-Intention (BDI) model

## Implementation Patterns

### 1. Agent Loop Pattern
```python
while True:
    percepts = perceive_environment()
    decision = reason(percepts, knowledge_base)
    action = select_action(decision)
    execute_action(action)
    update_knowledge(percepts, action, outcome)
```

### 2. Pipeline Pattern
```
Input → Preprocessing → Analysis → Decision → Action → Output
```

### 3. Multi-Agent Coordination
- **Hierarchical**: Manager agents coordinate worker agents
- **Peer-to-Peer**: Agents communicate directly
- **Market-Based**: Agents bid for tasks and resources
- **Consensus**: Agents vote on decisions

### 4. Tool Integration Pattern
```python
class Agent:
    def __init__(self):
        self.tools = {
            'search': web_search_tool,
            'calculate': calculator_tool,
            'email': email_tool
        }
    
    def execute_task(self, task):
        plan = self.create_plan(task)
        for step in plan:
            tool = self.select_tool(step)
            result = tool.execute(step)
            self.update_context(result)
